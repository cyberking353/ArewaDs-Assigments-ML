    "# Build a regression model using Scikit-learn: regression four ways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have explored what regression is with sample data gathered from the pumpkin pricing dataset that we will use throughout this lesson. You have also visualized it using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to dive deeper into regression for ML. While visualization allows you to make sense of data, the real power of Machine Learning comes from _training models_. Models are trained on historic data to automatically capture data dependencies, and they allow you to predict outcomes for new data, which the model has not seem before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn more about two types of regression: _basic linear regression_ and _polynomial regression_, along with some of the math underlying these techniques. Those models will allow us to predict pumpkin prices depending on different input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Throughout this curriculum, we assume minimal knowledge of math, and seek to make it accessible for students coming from other fields, so watch for notes, 🧮 callouts, diagrams, and other learning tools to aid in comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar by now with the structure of the pumpkin data that we are examining. You can find it preloaded and pre-cleaned in this lesson's _notebook.ipynb_ file. In the file, the pumpkin price is displayed per bushel in a new data frame.  Make sure you can run these notebooks in kernels in Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you are loading this data so as to ask questions of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When is the best time to buy pumpkins? \n",
    "- What price can I expect of a case of miniature pumpkins?\n",
    "- Should I buy them in half-bushel baskets or by the 1 1/9 bushel box?\n",
    "Let's keep digging into this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you created a Pandas data frame and populated it with part of the original dataset, standardizing the pricing by the bushel. By doing that, however, you were only able to gather about 400 datapoints and only for the fall months. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the data that we preloaded in this lesson's accompanying notebook. The data is preloaded and an initial scatterplot is charted to show month data. Maybe we can get a little more detail about the nature of the data by cleaning it more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A linear regression line\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in Lesson 1, the goal of a linear regression exercise is to be able to plot a line to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show variable relationships**. Show the relationship between variables\n",
    "- **Make predictions**. Make accurate predictions on where a new datapoint would fall in relationship to that line. \n",
    " \n",
    "It is typical of **Least-Squares Regression** to draw this type of line. The term 'least-squares' means that all the datapoints surrounding the regression line are squared and then added up. Ideally, that final sum is as small as possible, because we want a low number of errors, or `least-squares`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do so since we want to model a line that has the least cumulative distance from all of our data points. We also square the terms before adding them since we are concerned with its magnitude rather than its direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **🧮 Show me the math** \n",
    "> \n",
    "> This line, called the _line of best fit_ can be expressed by [an equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression): \n",
    "> \n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Y = a + bX\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `X` is the 'explanatory variable'. `Y` is the 'dependent variable'. The slope of the line is `b` and `a` is the y-intercept, which refers to the value of `Y` when `X = 0`. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">![calculate the slope](images/slope.png)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> First, calculate the slope `b`. Infographic by [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In other words, and referring to our pumpkin data's original question: \"predict the price of a pumpkin per bushel by month\", `X` would refer to the price and `Y` would refer to the month of sale. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">![complete the equation](images/calculation.png)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Calculate the value of Y. If you're paying around $4, it must be April! Infographic by [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The math that calculates the line must demonstrate the slope of the line, which is also dependent on the intercept, or where `Y` is situated when `X = 0`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can observe the method of calculation for these values on the [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html) web site. Also visit [this Least-squares calculator](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-calculator.html) to watch how the numbers' values impact the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "One more term to understand is the **Correlation Coefficient** between given X and Y variables. Using a scatterplot, you can quickly visualize this coefficient. A plot with datapoints scattered in a neat line have high correlation, but a plot with datapoints scattered everywhere between X and Y have a low correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good linear regression model will be one that has a high (nearer to 1 than 0) Correlation Coefficient using the Least-Squares Regression method with a line of regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Run the notebook accompanying this lesson and look at the Month to Price scatterplot. Does the data associating Month to Price for pumpkin sales seem to have high or low correlation, according to your visual interpretation of the scatterplot? Does that change if you use more fine-grained measure instead of `Month`, eg. *day of the year* (i.e. number of days since the beginning of the year)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will assume that we have cleaned up the data, and obtained a data frame called `new_pumpkins`, similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "ID | Month | DayOfYear | Variety | City | Package | Low Price | High Price | Price\n",
    "---|-------|-----------|---------|------|---------|-----------|------------|-------\n",
    "70 | 9 | 267 | PIE TYPE | BALTIMORE | 1 1/9 bushel cartons | 15.0 | 15.0 | 13.636364\n",
    "71 | 9 | 267 | PIE TYPE | BALTIMORE | 1 1/9 bushel cartons | 18.0 | 18.0 | 16.363636\n",
    "72 | 10 | 274 | PIE TYPE | BALTIMORE | 1 1/9 bushel cartons | 18.0 | 18.0 | 16.363636\n",
    "73 | 10 | 274 | PIE TYPE | BALTIMORE | 1 1/9 bushel cartons | 17.0 | 17.0 | 15.454545\n",
    "74 | 10 | 281 | PIE TYPE | BALTIMORE | 1 1/9 bushel cartons | 15.0 | 15.0 | 13.636364\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code to clean the data is available in [`notebook.ipynb`](notebook.ipynb). We have performed the same cleaning steps as in the previous lesson, and have calculated `DayOfYear` column using the following expression: "

In our case, there is just one coefficient, which should be around `-0.017`. It means that prices seem to drop a bit with time, but not too much, around 2 cents per day. We can also access the intersection point of the regression with Y-axis using `lin_reg.intercept_` - it will be around `21` in our case, indicating the price at the beginning of the year.\n",

    "## Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of Linear Regression is Polynomial Regression. While sometimes there's a linear relationship between variables - the bigger the pumpkin in volume, the higher the price - sometimes these relationships can't be plotted as a plane or straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Here are [some more examples](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/9/9.8) of data that could use Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Take another look at the relationship between Date and Price. Does this scatterplot seem like it should necessarily be analyzed by a straight line? Can't prices fluctuate? In this case, you can try polynomial regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Polynomials are mathematical expressions that might consist of one or more variables and coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial regression creates a curved line to better fit nonlinear data. In our case, if we include a squared `DayOfYear` variable into input data, we should be able to fit our data with a parabolic curve, which will have a minimum at a certain point within the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn includes a helpful [pipeline API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline.html?highlight=pipeline#sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline) to combine different steps of data processing together. A **pipeline** is a chain of **estimators**. In our case, we will create a pipeline that first adds polynomial features to our model, and then trains the regression:"

This is not the best idea for linear regression, because linear regression takes the actual numeric value of the index, and adds it to the result, multiplying by some coefficient. In our case, the relationship between the index number and the price is clearly non-linear, even if we make sure that indices are ordered in some specific way.\n",
    "* **One-hot encoding** will replace the `Variety` column by 4 different columns, one for each variety. Each column will contain `1` if the corresponding row is of a given variety, and `0` otherwise. This means that there will be four coefficients in linear regression, one for each pumpkin variety, responsible for \"starting price\" (or rather \"additional price\") for that particular variety.\n",
